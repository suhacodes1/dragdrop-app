### `npm test` 🔍

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more details on running tests, check out the [React testing documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/testing.html).

### `npm run build` 🔧

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The build is optimized for performance and minified. This version is ready for deployment.

### `npm run eject` ⚠️

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Ejecting removes the single build dependency and exposes the configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.). Once you eject, you can no longer go back. Use it only if you need custom configurations.
