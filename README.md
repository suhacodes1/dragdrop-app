Kanban Board React App
This project is a Kanban board built with React, utilizing drag-and-drop functionality with the react-beautiful-dnd library. It allows users to manage tasks in columns, drag tasks between columns, and provides an intuitive interface with a colorful design.

Getting Started

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it. The page will reload when you make changes. Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
You can find more details on running tests in the React documentation.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. The build is optimized for performance and minified. This version is ready for deployment.

For more information on deployment, check out the React documentation on deployment.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation.
Ejecting removes the single build dependency and exposes the configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.). Once you eject, you can no longer go back.

We recommend using eject only if you need custom configuration that isn't supported by Create React App's default setup.
